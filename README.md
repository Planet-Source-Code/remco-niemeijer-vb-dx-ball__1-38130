### Description

This is VB-DX-Ball, a Breakout-clone based on DX-Ball 2. I know what you're thinking: *sarcasm* "o wow, another breakout game!" */sarcasm*, but you really should check this out. Apart from being a good example of applying DirectX in an actual game (it uses DirectDraw, DirectInput, DirectSound and DirectMusic), it's also a very cool game.

When uploading this game, I got a time-out error every time, so I decided to devote a site to it. Just go to the downloads section and download the source-code version. After you checked it out, please come back here and tell me what you think of it.
